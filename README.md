# ARIMA-Driven Predictive Analytics for E-Commerce: Customer Churn Prediction and Grouping

## 📌 Overview
In the competitive e-commerce industry, customer retention is key to growth. This project combines **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** customer segmentation with **ARIMA** time series forecasting to predict customer churn. The aim is to identify high-risk customers in advance and support data-driven retention strategies.

We grouped customers into behavioral segments and applied ARIMA to forecast future engagement, allowing businesses to detect churn trends and act early.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
E-commerce platforms suffer from high customer churn due to inconsistent engagement. Without predictive insight into churn behavior, businesses cannot design effective retention efforts. This project addresses that by:
- Segmenting customers using RFM analysis
- Forecasting churn patterns using ARIMA
- Enabling proactive retention planning

## 🚀 Features
- RFM-based customer segmentation
- ARIMA modeling for time series churn forecasting
- Flask dashboard to visualize trends and forecasts
- Evaluation using RMSE and MAE metrics
- Real-world business insights for retention teams

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** — Data manipulation
- **ARIMA (Statsmodels)** — Time series modeling
- **Flask** — Lightweight web app framework
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** — Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** — Exploratory analysis

## 📊 Results
- ARIMA effectively captured seasonal churn patterns
- RMSE: `0.0267`
- MAE: `0.0213`
- Identified at-risk customer groups with interpretable visualizations
